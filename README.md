# Comprehensive Report: Streakly - Habit Tracking App

## 1. Purpose and Overview

### App Purpose
**Streakly** is a comprehensive habit-tracking Android application designed to help users build and maintain positive habits through consistent tracking, visual progress monitoring, and intelligent reminders. The app transforms habit formation from a daunting challenge into an engaging, data-driven journey.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Behavioral Psychology Integration**: Leverages streak mechanics and visual progress indicators to reinforce habit consistency
- **Multi-platform Accessibility**: Seamless synchronization between mobile devices and cloud storage
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Ensures uninterrupted habit tracking regardless of network connectivity
- **Personalized Analytics**: Provides actionable insights into habit patterns and completion trends

### Target Audience
- Individuals seeking to establish daily routines
- Productivity enthusiasts tracking multiple habits
- Users requiring flexible scheduling (daily, weekly, custom patterns)
- People valuing data privacy with optional cloud synchronization

## 2. Design Considerations

### Architecture Pattern
**MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** with Repository Pattern
```
Data Layer: Room Database + Retrofit API + Firebase Firestore
Domain Layer: Repository + Use Cases
Presentation Layer: ViewModel + LiveData/Flow + Activities/Fragments
```

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin with coroutines for asynchronous operations
- **Database**: Room (SQLite) for local storage
- **Networking**: Retrofit for REST API, Firebase for real-time sync
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with Google SSO integration
- **UI**: Material Design 3 with Jetpack Compose-ready architecture
- **Build System**: Gradle with version catalogs

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Offline-First Strategy
```kotlin
// Priority: Local DB → API Sync → Firebase Backup
implementation rationale:
- Ensures app functionality without internet
- Queues actions for later synchronization
- Provides immediate UI feedback
```

#### 2. Multi-Layer Data Persistence
```
Local SQLite → Custom API → Firebase Firestore
Advantages:
- Redundant data protection
- Flexible deployment options
- Gradual feature rollout capability
```

#### 3. Modular Feature Implementation
```
core/
├── authentication/
├── habits/
├── analytics/
├── notifications/
└── sync/
```

#### 4. Internationalization Framework
- RTL layout support
- Dynamic language switching
- Culturally appropriate date/time formatting
